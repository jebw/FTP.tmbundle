This is a super simple FTP Bundle for Textmate

You can add a hidden YAML file with some FTP settings in the TextMate Project
root, editable from Bundles -> FTP -> Edit FTP Settings

If this file is present in a Project, when you save a file, then it will also 
be uploaded to the FTP server set in the YAML file.
